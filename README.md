# Hurricane Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing data related to Category 5 hurricanes, the most powerful hurricanes based on wind speed. The goal is to write functions that organize and manipulate this data, including parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, and string manipulation.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Update recorded damage data.
- Consolidate data about hurricanes into a dictionary format.
- Group hurricanes by years and areas affected.
- Count how often each area is affected by hurricanes.
- Determine the area most affected by hurricanes.
- Identify the hurricane causing the most deaths.
- Rate hurricanes by mortality and damage scales.
- Find the hurricane causing the greatest damage.

## Key Learnings

Throughout this project, we covered the following concepts:

- Data manipulation using lists, dictionaries, and string manipulation.
- Writing functions to organize and analyze data.
- Using conditionals to categorize and rate hurricanes.
- Iterating through data using loops.
- Creating structured code using functions and dictionaries.
- Displaying data outputs using print statements.

## How to Use

1. Open the code files in a Python interpreter or editor.
2. Run the functions one by one to see their outputs and results.
3. Observe how the functions process hurricane data and perform analyses.

## Files

- `hurricane_analysis.py`: Contains the functions to analyze hurricane data.

## Conclusion

This project provided hands-on experience in data manipulation, function creation, and basic analysis using Python. By exploring and working with real-world data related to hurricanes, we gained practical skills that can be applied to a wide range of data analysis tasks.

Feel free to explore the code, modify functions, and extend the analyses to further develop your programming skills!
